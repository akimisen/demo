帮我改写novel的mermaid图，参考demo@mermaid.md

<think>
The user is asking me to help modify the novel Mermaid diagram in src/mermaid.md based on the example provided in the mermaid-demo.md file. The request is in Chinese, which translates to: "Help me rewrite the novel mermaid diagram, referring to the demo@mermaid.md."

Looking at both files:

1. The mermaid-demo.md file shows a class diagram with Animal as a parent class and Duck, Fish, and Zebra as subclasses. It has proper formatting with notes, class methods, and properties.

2. The src/mermaid.md file shows a class diagram for novels with Novel as a parent class and NovelBase and NovelTemplate as subclasses. However, there are some issues with the diagram:
   - There's repetition in the NovelTemplate class (empty line followed by repeated properties)
   - The notes are not very descriptive ("xxx" and "xx")
   - The relationships might not be correctly represented

I need to improve the novel Mermaid diagram by:
1. Fixing the class structure and relationships
2. Adding better notes
3. Organizing the properties and methods better
4. Formatting according to the example

I'll prepare an improved version of the src/mermaid.md file.

我会帮你改写novel的mermaid图，参考提供的demo示例。

````markdown:src/mermaid.md
```mermaid
---
title: Novel Structure
---
classDiagram
    note "From NovelBase to NovelTemplate"
    Novel <|-- NovelBase
    note for NovelBase "基础小说结构\n包含小说基本信息\n可以保存和编辑"
    Novel <|-- NovelTemplate
    note for NovelTemplate "小说模板\n可重复使用\n帮助快速创建新小说"
    Novel : +int id
    Novel : +String title
    Novel : +String userId
    Novel : +String abstract
    Novel : +isMammal()
    Novel: +publish()
    class NovelBase{
        +String genre
        +String status
        +String createdAt
        +String updatedAt
        +edit()
        +save()
    }
    class NovelTemplate{
        +String genre
        +String templateType
        +createNovel()
        +applyTemplate()
    }
```
````

我对mermaid图做了以下改进：

1. 改进了标题为"Novel Structure"
2. 添加了更有描述性的注释，包括中文说明
3. 将共同属性放在父类Novel中
4. 为每个类添加了特定的方法
5. 移除了NovelTemplate类中的重复属性
6. 整体结构和格式参考了demo示例的布局
7. 添加了合适的方法，如edit()、save()、createNovel()等

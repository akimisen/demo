我的novelist中的novellisttable为什么不能正确加载数据？vite报错和页面截图如图

---

_**Assistant**_

<think>Based on the error message and screenshot provided, I need to analyze why the novel list table isn't loading correctly. Let's break down the issue:

1. The error message shows: `[vite] http proxy error: /api/novels?pageIndex=1&pageSize=10&query=&sort[order]=&sort[key]=` with `AggregateError [ECONNREFUSED]`.

2. The screenshot shows a UI with a table that displays "No data found!" in Chinese.

3. We have access to the code from `src/mock/fakeApi/novelFakeApi.ts`, which appears to be handling the mock API for novels.

The error suggests that there's a connection issue when trying to access the `/api/novels` endpoint. This is likely happening because:

1. The API request is being refused (ECONNREFUSED error)
2. There might be something wrong with how the mock API is set up

Looking at the code:
- There's a mock setup for the `/api/novels` endpoint
- It processes parameters like pageIndex, pageSize, sort, and query
- It uses novelListData as the data source
- It applies sorting and filtering based on the parameters

Potential issues:
1. The mock adapter might not be properly initialized or connected
2. The novelListData might be empty or undefined
3. There could be an issue with how the sort parameters are being handled
4. The server or mock service might not be running

Let me check if there are any obvious issues in the visible code:

- Line 11 is trying to destructure `sort` into `order` and `key`, but the error URL shows `sort[order]=&sort[key]=` which could indicate the format is different than expected
- There could be an issue with how the parameters are being parsed in the mock handler

I need to investigate:
1. The mock setup in the project
2. How the novelListData is defined and loaded
3. How the API is being called from the frontend
4. Whether the mock server is properly running</think># Novel List Table Loading Issue Analysis

Based on the error message and screenshot, I can see that your novel list table isn't loading data because of a connection error to the API endpoint.

## The Error

The error shows:
```
[vite] http proxy error: /api/novels?pageIndex=1&pageSize=10&query=&sort[order]=&sort[key]=
AggregateError [ECONNREFUSED]
```

This indicates that the request to the `/api/novels` endpoint is being refused - meaning the connection to the API server is failing.

Let me look at your mock API setup to identify the issue.

<think>The MockAdapter.ts file shows that the mock adapter is being initialized with AxiosBase, which appears to be a custom axios instance used in the application.

<think>I notice an important issue. Looking at the mock/index.ts file, it loads various fake API modules, but I don't see the `novelFakeApi.ts` being imported! This is likely why the `/api/novels` endpoint is not being mocked properly, resulting in the ECONNREFUSED error.

Let's check the novelData file to make sure the data source exists:</think># Novel List Table Loading Issue Analysis

I've identified the issue with your novel list table not loading data correctly. The problem appears to be related to how your mock API system is configured.

## The Root Cause

After examining your mock setup, I can see that **your `novelFakeApi.ts` is not being imported in the main mock index file**. Let me explain:

1. In your `src/mock/index.ts` file, you import various fake API modules like:
   ```javascript
   import './fakeApi/authFakeApi'
   import './fakeApi/commonFakeApi'
   import './fakeApi/customersFakeApi'
   // and many others...
   ```

2. However, there's no import for `novelFakeApi.ts`, which means:
   - The mock adapter never registers the handler for the `/api/novels` endpoint
   - When your application makes a request to this endpoint, it tries to reach a real server instead of using the mock
   - Since there's no real server running at that endpoint, you get the ECONNREFUSED error

## How to Fix It

You need to add an import for the novel fake API in your `src/mock/index.ts` file:

```javascript:src/mock/index.ts
// ... existing imports
import './fakeApi/authFakeApi'
import './fakeApi/commonFakeApi'
// ... other imports

// Add this line
import './fakeApi/novelFakeApi'

mock.onAny().passThrough()
```

This will ensure that your mock handler for `/api/novels` is registered and can intercept API requests to that endpoint, allowing your novel list table to load the mock data correctly.

After making this change, the API calls should be properly handled by your mock system instead of trying to reach an external server, and your novel list table should display the data from `novelListData`.

如何从git中忽略不需要的文件

---

_**Assistant**_

要从 Git 中忽略不需要的文件，你可以使用 `.gitignore` 文件。以下是步骤：

1. **打开或创建 `.gitignore` 文件**：
   - 在你的项目根目录下，查找 `.gitignore` 文件。如果没有，创建一个新的文件并命名为 `.gitignore`。

2. **添加要忽略的文件或目录**：
   - 在 `.gitignore` 文件中，添加你想要忽略的文件或目录的路径。例如：
     ```
     # 忽略特定文件
     .specstory/history/.what-is-this.md

     # 忽略特定目录
     /node_modules/
     ```

3. **保存并关闭 `.gitignore` 文件**。

4. **从 Git 中移除已跟踪的文件**（如果文件已经被跟踪）：
   - 如果你已经将文件添加到 Git 中，你需要先将其从 Git 中移除。使用以下命令：
     ```bash
     git rm --cached .specstory/history/.what-is-this.md
     ```

5. **提交更改**：
   - 提交你的更改以更新 Git 状态：
     ```bash
     git add .gitignore
     git commit -m "Update .gitignore to ignore unnecessary files"
     ```

完成这些步骤后，Git 将忽略你在 `.gitignore` 文件中指定的文件或目录。
